<p>i was born in Augusta, Maine, with my Mom Jen. My father was in Warren maximum Security, and it was a tough beginning to my life not having him around. the first time I met him I was four years old. I loved him, I think its mainly because my mother was a drug addict and just didnt treat me right. I felt closure when my Father was there, because my only memories with him were just loving, and my mothers memories were just bad. Soon, a year later, my father passed away when I was 5. It was probably the hardest thing I have ever gone through and due to my mothers addictions I was just not meant to be there on Sand Hill, Augusta Maine. So my grandmother took me in, and 2 years later my mother passed away at the age of 7, but I didnt really feel much pain because she just wasn't there and didnt help me develop into anything but an anxiety fueled kid. My grandmother is my ABSOLUTE rock, she has done everything, and sacrificed everything to push me to play hockey, and give me what I dreamed of and in my head, tried her hardest to make up for the scattered life I came from. To this day I live with her, and I would do anything for this women. I really cant even describe our relationship, I'd be living with people I didnt even know, if it wasn't for her.</p>

<p>Here is just a random picture of me next to the lake! I felt as a picture with me infront of the lake that has so many memories to me would be neat!<p/>

<P>My schooling was a little rough<p/>

<p><a href="https://www.kidsrsu.org/o/hdmhs">Hall-Dale</a> elementary and middle school is where my schooling all began. I was a little chubbier then I am now(I'm being nice to myself) and kids saw so and didn't really treat me right. I really only had one friend, his name was Fred and he's been here since day one and hasn't budged. When it came time to move on to high-school, Fred was moving to <a href="http://www.wiscasset.org">Wiscasset, ME.</a> and I was NOT about to stay at a place that I was treated so bad without at least one friend. so I decided to move. Me and my grandmother started thinking, and we already lived in winthrop but I went to Hall-dale over a intendants agreement, so we decided to start highschool fresh at <a href="https://district.winthropschools.org">Winthrop High-school.</a></P>

<header>Where I live now!</header>

<p>I now live in the same place as I did since my grandmother took me in, but it is such a beautiful place and such a
    change from what my life would have been if it wasnt for her so I feel the need to expand on it a bit. We live right on lake <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobbosseecontee_Lake">Cobbossee!<a/> It is so pretty, holding so many views and sites and one of the first light houses in maine! Now that it is frozen me and all my friends walk to the light house and watch the sun come up some occasions.<p/>
