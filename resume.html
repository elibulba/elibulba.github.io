<header>Vet Home Experience:</header>
<p>So it all started in middle-school when I was just a kid with a heart full of love and care! My friends mother worked at the Maine Vets home and she quickly got my an interview! Once I was on payroll I was finally assigned jobs, keep in mind lives are at risk during these jobs, so there was a little amount of training to do prior to actually working. At first I was just playing board games with veterans, sharing stories and meeting new people that were very interesting! Then after my training was completed it turned into helping them get up, get to food, bring them food, get to home events, setting up home events and much more! During this job I really did learn a lot, and along with that, took a lot out from it. I learned to embrace being young, and to cherish the time I have out of a wheelchair. I learned how humble veterans are even after fighting there whole lives for our freedom and then ending up in a wheelchair needing help. I also think in my opinion it helped a lot with my life now. My grandmother is slowing down as some would say, and she is starting to need some help, and I feel as I do the up-most I can possibly do as a human for her and I know for a fact she appreciates it. Last but not least it taught me hard work, it taught me to learn how to deal with a schedule away from the schooling aspect, and to just be dedicated to something I have a heart for. </p>

<header>EJP Experience:</header>

<p>Speaking about my experiences with EJP is just remarkable. I had such a good time and it toughened me right up. It made me stronger, more determined, more hard working, helped me deal with my own brain under very intense distress and really shaped me as a person. In high-school, I went to teh voke program that most schools offer, I was in the construction program! That is what gave me the experience I needed to get my foot into the door and is honeslty what made Eric(the owner) really like me and what led him to decide to hire me! I loved this job because I was an <a href="http://careers.stateuniversity.com/pages/247/Demolition-Worker.html">Demolition Laborer</a>, you can find out more by clicking on the link aside, but I will give a brief overview of one of our jobs I was apart of. </p>

<p>So for this job I tried to find the actually link to our chemistry branch renovation but I could not find it, all I could find was its general website for the building we were at. Anyhow, as a demo laborer I was apart of sledge hammering all the desks, sinks, chairs, walls, carpet, ceilings, and everything that basically makes a room, a room! Once we completely destroyed both chemistry rooms, it was time to get all the debris out of the room and being its inside of a school, wheel-barrows was how it was done. Finally once the room was clear and open, it was time to look at our blueprints, this is where I started to use my knowledge from my voke classes and also started learning at the same time. We had to cut a 20'x25' hole in the solid cement floor, and in the middle of this outline that was cut by our $20,000 machine we had to cut little squares, almost like a checker board so we could humanly haul all the debris out. The reason for this is because lifting a 20,000lb slab of cement is nearly impossible, so lifting, and jackhammering little squares was much easier. once all of it was out of the room then it was time to re-evaluate our blue prints. It was time to dig down with a micro-escavator and find all the gas lines, water lines, drains, and electrical lines. Finding them was hard but once we found them it was time to relocate everything. The main objective we had was to create two futuristic chem labs. With six stationary desks, with a sink, two gas lines and a drain in each. Being that there were six, we had to measure how far out from, the walls, where to put them, and on top of everything how we'd tie the lines all together underground. We had to call in 3 sub-contractors for the drains, electrical systems and water. In all it was a great project to be a part of and helped me gain an immense amount of knowledge for what a commercial construction job site looked and felt like, especially being a laborer involved in such a project. </p>
