    <p>I go to the University of Maine at Orono. Our campus is set on a island! The University of Maine at Orono is a great campus and has lots to offer. There are many meaningful buildings that are named after very famous people, sites that you just wouldnt expect from a campus with such a population, and art gallerys with student created projects and also from very prestigious people! These can all be found here</p>

        <p>I was chasing a Engineering major until I realized I was not a math head. I now am persueing a business major. I played hockey my whole life, but sadly cannot compete with the compitition here. Next year, I am thinking of really devoting myself to hockey and try out for the club team being the D1 team picks up from club. I have a bunch of pictures and cool videos of me playing hockey! You MAY need a <a href="https://www.instagram.com">Instagram</a> but if so I have tons of incredible pictures and game footage. Below you can find three pages, the first one will link you to my game footage(Must have an Instagram account), the second will go in-depth about my personal life and family, and finally the last is my work experience </<p>
